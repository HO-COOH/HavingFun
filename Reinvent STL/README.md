# Reinvent STL
This project aims to reinvent the C++ STL library.

## Why
Because reinventing the wheel is sometimes the best way to learn.

## Goal
1. Use some of the foundamental part of standard library (like type_traits, dynamic memory allocation) to implement the main STL containers
2. Implement those foundamental part like type_traits, dynamic memory allocation with no dependency
3. Find and remove all `std` with my own namespace, and it should still works.
